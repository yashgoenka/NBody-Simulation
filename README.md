# NBody-Simulation
A program for simulating the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation.

To see an animated simulation run the following:  
`javac NBody.java`  
`java NBody 157788000.0 25000.0 data/planets.txt`  

Make sure to also try out some of the other simulations, which can all be found in the data directory. Some of them are very cool.
